## MyHomepage

### Key features that I have included/worked-upon in this webpage-
- Custom-text animation in the header section of the webpage (*it took a lot of time :p*)
- A central nav bar which also includes my social media profiles (the wordpress button *is not a link*).
- Image with a transparent background and rounded corners.
- A short description of myself using a **Google font**.
- A footer section which includes a quote.
- A logo "PG" for my webpage.
- Lastly and **most importantly**, I have tried to make my webpage as responsive as possible so that it can be viewed comfortably from mobile devices.
